  I was leading a review session in a computer science course, and I had a review game based on Jeopardy.  I needed a way for participants to buzz in an answer, and I couldn't find anything free that could tell me exactly who buzzed in first.  So I threw this together in an hour.  All it does is play a buzzing sound.  Enjoy.
