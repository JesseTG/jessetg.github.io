  It's a cross-platform shader editor!  It started as a project for a graphics course, then evolved into my undergraduate capstone project; now I plan on making it even better for my Master's thesis.  You'll be able to provide arbitrary data to shaders, fine-tune them through UI controls that automagically appear and just <em>work</em>, and then save the whole thing to XML (or as individual shaders).  I'm aiming to make this easy to use, even for amateur graphics programmers.
