  My take on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SameGame" target="_blank" rel="external">SameGame</a>, known by umpteen different names outside of Japan.  This was originally made as part of the application process for a game dev studio, but I liked it enough to continue to polish it further.  The main draw for Rosie over SameGame is its faster-paced mechanics, employed with revolving gravity and a timer.
