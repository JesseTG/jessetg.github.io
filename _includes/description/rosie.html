  My take on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SameGame" target="_blank" rel="external">SameGame</a>, known by umpteen different names outside of Japan.  This was originally made as part of the application process for a game dev studio, but I liked it enough to continue to polish it further.  Rosie is a bit more fast-paced, though; rather than playing until you run out of moves, you're placed on a timer.  When you run out of moves, the game refills the board instead of simply ending.  Also, gravity rotates every turn.
