  This was the final project for an art course I took last year.  It's an homage to old-school computer graphics research; some papers would be accompanied by relevant videos.  Advancements in 3D Imagery is a video for a hypothetical literature review of computer graphics techniques available in the mid-1970's.  The music is my own.
