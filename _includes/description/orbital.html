  Orbital is supposed to be one of those casual games played in rapid succession, not unlike Flappy Bird or 2048.  In Orbital, you have a star in the center, and you must place as many planets in orbit around this star as you can without any of them colliding.  You get one point for each planet that completes its first revolution around the star.  This was fun to make, I'm going to polish this and sell it over the next few weeks.
