  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1510" target="_blank">Uplink</a> is a hacking simulation game released by <a href="https://www.introversion.co.uk">Introversion Software</a>.  UplinkOS is a mod by <a href="http://www.tudorstamate.com">Tudor Stamate</a> that wildly overhauls the UI.  It was only released for Windows, but I'm in the process of porting it to Linux and macOS.
