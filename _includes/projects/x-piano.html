This was originally made for a computer music course, but I'll be polishing this up and adding extra features in the coming weeks.  X Piano lets you upload your own sound effects to use as piano keys; you can also apply several filters to the resulting sound.  I plan on submitting this to a few web technology galleries in the coming weeks.
