It's a cross-platform shader editor!  At the moment I'm writing this for a graphics course, though I may continue to work on it for my senior project.  You'll be able to provide arbitrary data to shaders, fine-tune them through UI controls that automagically appear and just <em>work</em>, and then save the whole thing to XML (or as individual shaders).  I'm aiming to make this easy to use, even for amateur graphics programmers.
