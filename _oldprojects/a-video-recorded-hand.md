  A Video Recorded Hand is more of a parody than a straight-faced homage like Advancements in 3D Imagery is.  It represents the impact massive advances in video technology in the past four and a half decades have made on our ability to produce content (i.e. "lol hands").  I made this in about four hours, which reflects this piece's very meaning!
