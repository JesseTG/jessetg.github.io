  This one I'm particularly proud of.  X Piano lets you upload your own sound effects to use as piano keys; you can also apply several filters to the resulting sound.  I originally made this for a computer music course, but I've since polished it up and submitted it to Chrome Experiments, <a href="https://www.chromeexperiments.com/experiment/x-piano" target="_blank" rel="external">to which it was accepted</a>!
