I'm making a case for my Arduino, for some reason.  I'll be getting this fabricated with the computer science building's laser cutter tomorrow (already bought some acrylic to use).  I'm not sure I really know what I'm doing, so I just stuck the pieces together in Inkscape and am hoping for the best.

I started by using [MakerCase](http://www.makercase.com/) to generate a case template that's just a little bit bigger than my Arduino.  Then I had to come up with a design.  This was tedious, but it was ultimately like making puzzle pieces by hand.  The hard part was counting the tabs and gaps, and making sure I don't mix them up; otherwise *nothing's* gonna fit.

And, of course, I couldn't resist adding a bit of a personal touch.  I'd had the idea for a personal logo for a while now, but I never got around to making one.  Here's the excuse I wanted.  Fingers crossed that it doesn't come out like crap!
