The other day I had a first draft of an Arduino case.  How did it go?  Well...

{% include picture.html src="/images/blog/failed-case.jpg" alt="Failed Arduino case" sources=page.failed-case %}

Ahem.

{% include picture.html src="/images/blog/you-tried.png" alt="'You Tried' within a star" sources=page.you-tried class="center-block" width="240" height="240" %}

I fucked up the kerf.  Oops.  At least the photo I took is *damn* fine.

Here's another attempt:

<style>
main svg g path, main svg g {
    stroke: white;
    stroke-width: 0.9;
}
</style>

<a href="/images/blog/caseplans-v2.svg" alt="Improved case design for an Arduino">{% include svg/caseplans-v2.svg %}</a>

I haven't had the chance to try this out yet.

The real file looks different because the laser cutter in the lab needs the lines to be set up in a particular way that's not friendly to the eye.  Good thing you can style SVG with CSS.
