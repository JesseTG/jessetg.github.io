  Last semester I took a course on the history of photography, and a web design course focused on the aesthetic capabilities of the Internet (as opposed to, say, a three-month tutorial in HTML and CSS).  I've since become more appreciative of the fundamental relationship between art and science; it's not always obvious, but the two exist in an feedback loop.

  Recent advances in graphics are driven by a desire for a greater potential for expression in game design.  This unlocked power then inspires others to come up with better and badder ways to use it.  The camera was invented out of a desire to capture the world more accurately, and the ability to do that led to scientists discovering its applications for their own work, and then scientific photography became an aesthetic movement in its own right.  Oh, and of course, the Internet and everything about it.

  That's why I decided to put some thought into creating something <em>I</em> felt was interesting for our latest HCI assignment.  Look at this panorama:

  {% include picture.html src="/images/art/full/panorama.jpg" alt="Panorama" sources=page.pictures %}
</p>

  The subject an Arduino, a breadboard, and an RGB LED blinking in a pattern whose determination I leave as an exercise to the reader.  Thankfully, I didn't have to screw around with Ohm's Law or anything, the LED just happened to be a good fit.  I like how I used the colors, personally.  You know, I might actually do this kind of thing more often.

  If you want to see what I did (and it's very simple, honestly), the Fritzing file is right <a href="/files/panorama.fzz">here</a>.
