Although I didn't contribute to the Entitas codebase, I helped out in several other ways:

- I contributed extensive documentation to its wiki,
  mostly for the bundled code generator named Jenny.
  (This was before .NET had introduced Source Generators.)
- I led the migration from Gitter to Discord server,
  which I moderated for a while.
